# Django Tutorial Polls App (Dockerized)

This repository contains the complete code for the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) project's [tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial01/) `polls` app. The code should mirror the code you've written at the end of [Part 7](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/intro/tutorial07/). 

In this branch of the repository, the Django project code has been modified to work in a Docker-based environment, as described in [How to Build a Django and Gunicorn Application with Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-django-and-gunicorn-application-with-docker).

Sensitive variables in the `env` file have been scrubbed. Instructions for filling in these configuration variables are available in the accompanying DigitalOcean [tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-django-and-gunicorn-application-with-docker)

This app is meant to be used as a reference Django app for several DigitalOcean tutorials, and should not be deployed in production.
